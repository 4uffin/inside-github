# I want Linux to be good, so bad...

I love Linux, I do, but unfortunately I can't JUST have it on my machine and NOT dual boot Windows as well.

Like, Linux for me is great... UNTIL... I want to do pretty much any gaming. I just run into runtime issues, compatibility issues, drivers just refusing to work properly, my entire Linux install getting messed up due to a game crash/freeze.

For this reason, I use Linux for basically everythingâ€”until I want to game.
Maybe someday this will change, but for now... this sucks :(
