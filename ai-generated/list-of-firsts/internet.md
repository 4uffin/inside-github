# Summary

The history of the Internet is marked by a series of groundbreaking “firsts” that paved the way for today’s digital world. It began with the first packet-switched message sent over ARPANET on October 29, 1969 <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/blogs/details/the-first-message-transmission-29-10-2019-en">ICANN</a> and continued with Ray Tomlinson’s first email in 1971 <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/8/60/1971-first-ever-email-392973">Guinness World Records</a>. Soon thereafter, the first File Transfer Protocol (FTP) specification was published in April 1971 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">Wikipedia</a>, and the commercial Internet era truly began when the first .com domain, symbolics.com, was registered on March 15, 1985 <a href="https://www.edn.com/1st-com-domain-name-is-registered-march-15-1985/">EDN</a>. Key innovations followed, including the first online chat via IRC in 1988 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarkko_Oikarinen">Wikipedia</a>, the earliest Internet search engine “Archie” in 1990 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_%28search_engine%29">Wikipedia</a>, and Tim Berners‑Lee’s creation of the WorldWideWeb browser later that year <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb.html">W3C</a>. The very first website went live at CERN on August 6, 1991 <a href="https://www.history.com/articles/the-worlds-first-web-site">HISTORY</a>, and the web’s multimedia capabilities grew with the first image upload in July 1992 <a href="https://www.thequint.com/tech-and-auto/tech-news/heres-the-first-photo-ever-uploaded-on-internet-24-years-ago">The Quint</a>. Social networking began with SixDegrees in 1997 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SixDegrees.com">Wikipedia</a>, and the dawn of user‑generated video content arrived on April 23, 2005 with the first YouTube upload, “Me at the zoo” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_at_the_zoo">Wikipedia</a>.
