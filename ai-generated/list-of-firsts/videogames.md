# Overview
Below is a chronological list of “firsts” in video‑game history—from the earliest electronic amusements through the dawn of home consoles and handhelds. Each entry highlights a groundbreaking milestone and its year of introduction.

# A single summary paragraph at the top:
In 1947, the first interactive electronic game concept emerged with the “Cathode‑Ray Tube Amusement Device,” predating any digital computers. Early 1950s research machines like Bertie the Brain (1950) and Nimrod (1951) introduced computer‑driven gameplay, followed by Douglas’s OXO (1952) on the EDSAC. William Higinbotham’s Tennis for Two (1958) brought analog computer sports to an oscilloscope. The first true digital video game with real‑time animation appeared in 1962 with Spacewar! Commercial arcades began in 1971 with Computer Space and prototype Galaxy Game, while Pong (1972) became gaming’s first mass‑market sensation. Home consoles debuted with the Magnavox Odyssey (1972), followed by cartridge‑based systems like the Fairchild Channel F (1976) and the wildly popular Atari 2600 (1977). Finally, Mattel’s Auto Race (1976) pioneered the handheld electronic game, setting the stage for personal gaming on the go.

### 1. Earliest Electronic Interactive Game
#### 1947 – Cathode‑Ray Tube Amusement Device
The first known interactive electronic game concept was patented in 1947 by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann as the “Cathode‑Ray Tube Amusement Device,” using purely analog electronics and a CRT to simulate artillery trajectories​ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube_amusement_device">Wikipedia</a> <a href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=3573">History of Information</a>. Under many definitions it is not considered a “video game” because it lacked a computing device, but it remains the earliest electronic display‑based interactive game​ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube_amusement_device">Wikipedia</a>.

### 2. Early Computer‑Based Games
#### 1950 – Bertie the Brain
Built by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition, Bertie the Brain was a four‑meter‑tall computer that let visitors play tic‑tac‑toe against an AI via illuminated light grids and a keypad, making it one of the first digital computer games to offer an interactive experience​ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertie_the_Brain">Wikipedia</a> <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%A7%E8%85%A6%E4%BC%AF%E8%92%82">维基百科，自由的百科全书</a>.

#### 1951 – Nimrod
Developed by Ferranti for Britain’s 1951 Festival of Britain, Nimrod was a custom‑built computer that played the mathematical game Nim against the public, displayed via panels of lights, and demonstrated computers’ recreational potential​ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod_%28computer%29">Wikipedia</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/06/replay/">WIRED</a>.

#### 1952 – OXO (Noughts and Crosses)
As part of his PhD thesis at Cambridge, A. S. Douglas programmed OXO on the EDSAC mainframe in 1952 to let a human play tic‑tac‑toe against the computer, using one of the machine’s CRTs for graphical display—one of the earliest video games to use a stored‑program computer and move beyond static light panels​ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OXO_%28video_game%29">Wikipedia</a> <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/1952/">CHM</a>.

### 3. Analog Computer Sports Simulation
#### 1958 – Tennis for Two
Physicist William Higinbotham created Tennis for Two for Brookhaven National Laboratory’s 1958 exhibition: an analog computer tennis sim displayed on a five‑inch oscilloscope, with two controllers and real‑time ball trajectory based on simulated gravity and wind resistance​ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_for_Two">Wikipedia</a> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/about/history/firstvideo.php">Brookhaven National Laboratory</a>.

### 4. First Real‑Time Digital Video Game
#### 1962 – Spacewar!
MIT students developed Spacewar! on the DEC PDP‑1 in 1962, featuring two spaceships dueling under the influence of a central star’s gravity, with real‑time vector graphics—the first widely recognized digital computer game on a video display​ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games">Wikipedia</a>.

### 5. Dawn of the Arcade Industry
#### 1971 – Computer Space
Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney’s Computer Space (November 1971) was the first commercial arcade video game, based on Spacewar! and sold under their Syzygy Engineering partnership (later Atari)​ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_history_of_video_games">Wikipedia</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games">Wikipedia</a>.

#### 1971 – Galaxy Game
Developed at Stanford University in late 1971, Galaxy Game was a coin‑op prototype of Spacewar! built on a DEC PDP‑11, popular locally but never mass‑produced due to cost​ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_history_of_video_games">Wikipedia</a>.

### 6. First Mass‑Market Arcade Hit
#### 1972 – Pong
Pong, released by Atari in 1972, became the first commercially successful video game and the first truly widespread arcade sports title, selling thousands of units and establishing the coin‑op industry​ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_history_of_video_games">Wikipedia</a>.

### 7. First Home Consoles
#### 1972 – Magnavox Odyssey
The Magnavox Odyssey, launched in May 1972, was the first home video game console—using cartridges that altered circuitry to play various simple games on a television set​ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games">Wikipedia</a>.

#### 1976 – Fairchild Channel F
Released in November 1976, the Fairchild Channel F was the first console to use a microprocessor and interchangeable ROM cartridges, pioneering the format that became industry standard​ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_years_in_video_games">Wikipedia</a>.

#### 1977 – Atari Video Computer System (2600)
Debuting in September 1977, the Atari 2600 became the first home console to achieve widespread popularity, with a library of hundreds of games and mainstream cultural impact​ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_years_in_video_games">Wikipedia</a>.

### 8. First Handheld Electronic Game
#### 1976 – Mattel Auto Race
Released in 1976 by Mattel Electronics, Auto Race was the first handheld electronic game to use only solid‑state electronics—no mechanical parts—displaying cars as moving LEDs and pioneering portable gaming devices​ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattel_Auto_Race">Wikipedia</a> <a href="https://www.westporttechmuseum.com/products/mattel-auto-race-1976">Westport Tech Museum</a>.
